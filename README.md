> An Yeoman generator to create a basic [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) structure.


## Getting Started

### About

This script is an [Yeoman Generator](http://yeoman.io/), meant to be used with some Javascript modern tools such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.org), [Bower](http://bower.io/), etc.

### Module specs

A module generated by this application will use the [returnExportsGlobal](https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/returnExportsGlobal.js) definition from [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd).

The generated module will provide support to both AMD([RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and global namespace definition.

#### Support files

File definition for both **npm** and **Bower** package managers will be also generated along with the initial structure.

A simple [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) test suit will be available with some dummy tests.


## Setup

You will need to have at least **npm** previously installed on your machine.

1) Install the [Yeoman CLI](https://github.com/yeoman/yo)

```shell
npm install -g yo
```

2) Install the UMD Generator

```shell
npm install -g generator-umd
```


## Todo

### Support a way of easily adding dependencies

If you need to consume other libraries from inside your module, you will have to take a look at the [UMD spec](https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/returnExportsGlobal.js) and implement it by yourself.

I have plans to add this feature in a subgenerator, using the comment metadata from the generated module file.
